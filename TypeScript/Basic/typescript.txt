Type Safety -> 

It detect error in the code before running the code while js detect that errors during run time. 

Static Checking 

.ts || .tsx --> extension

TS -> JS [compiled internally]

TS is development tool ! 
TS is just a superset of JS [wrapper]

TS has 2 different type of installation. In project we need to configure a ts config file. 

tsc -v => Version x.x.x
D:\courses\Typescript>tsc intro.ts

Types -

new types in ts - Any, Never, unknown, void, undefined, null


for production level  - > 

1st command -> tsc --init [to make config file]

npm init -y [it create a package,json file]
just for info


We need to make a dist folder [known for production or serving or final] and in this we will create the index.js from our index.ts.
so to do so we have to modify ts config file (// "outDir": "./", )
location of output directory ["outDir": "./dist",]
Now, remember that when you compile manually like tsc index.js it won't look for config means it generate the compiled js file in same dir but when you use tsc -w then its start a watch mode [quite similar to nodemon ]  and compile as pper config file
